**4. Defining Success Metrics**

The next crucial step is defining success metrics. Success in the context of IGTV can be measured through various key performance indicators (KPIs). Some potential metrics to consider include:

   a. **User Engagement**: Track metrics like likes, comments, shares, and views to assess how engaged users are with IGTV content.
   
   b. **Retention Rate**: Monitor how often users return to IGTV to consume content over time.
   
   c. **Ad Revenue**: If IGTV includes ads, ad revenue is a vital metric to measure.
   
   d. **Content Popularity**: Identify the most popular types of content, influencers, or creators on IGTV.
